    <center><strong>Core Value: HOLINESS</strong></center><br><br>
    <center><strong><em> "Be Holy" (1 Peter 1:15-16) </em></strong></center><br>
Holiness is not merely the absence of sin, but as a positive, active, and "set apart" life dedicated to God that transforms character and conduct that reflects the character and nature  of God. <br>
Love, humility, obedience, integrity, and excellence are central components and expressions of holiness in Christian theology.<br>
Here is how each component relates to holiness:<br>
• Love: Love is considered the core constitution of God’s holiness.  Holiness is demonstrated through selfless, pure love for God and others, making it a non-negotiable aspect of a holy life.  Without love, one is not considered holy.<br>
• Humility: Humility is seen as a foundational virtue for holiness, acting as the starting point for a journey with Christ.  It is essential for a holy life because it counters prideful, self-righteousness.  
It is considered the one thing needed for God's holiness to dwell in a person, as it allows for recognition of God's greatness over oneself.<br>
• Obedience: Holiness is demonstrated through constant obedience to God's commands and submission to His will. It is seen as a tangible expression of love for God.<br>
• Integrity: Integrity is crucial for holiness, which involves consistency in actions and being "one" or complete in character.  A holy person must have integrity, which includes fidelity in small, daily actions.  
A holy life is described as having an inner and outer life fully aligned. There can be no true holiness without integrity.<br>
• Excellence: Often associated with striving for maturity (perfection) and doing everything heartily as unto the Lord.  As believers are called to represent God, striving for excellence—doing things in the best possible way 
rather than settling for mediocrity—is a reflection of God’s own nature.  It is about bringing glory to God through one's best work. <br>
Holiness is "spiritual wholeness or completeness", which is achieved when these components are present.  They are often described as the "spiritual wardrobe" of believers, embodying the nature of Christ. 
It is powered by the Holy Spirit rather than just human effort. <br>   
  </p>

  <p>
    <center><strong>AFFIRMATION OF FAITH</strong></center><br><br>
    • The Holy Bible as the anointed words of God inspired by the Holy Spirit.<br>
    • One God eternally existing in three divine persons: God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit.<br>
    • Jesus Christ is the only begotten Son of God, conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of a virgin.<br>
    • The fall of man.<br>
    • The divine plan of salvation through grace and redemption.<br>
    • New birth and water baptism by immersion.<br>
    • The holiness of life.<br>
    • The holy communion.<br>
    • The baptism of the Holy Spirit.<br>
    • The power of divine healing.<br>
    • The second coming of Jesus Christ.<br>
    • Eternal life for the righteous and eternal punishment for the wicked.
